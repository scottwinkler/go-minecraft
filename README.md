Minecraft Go Client
==============================

This is an API client for [terraform-minecraft-plugin](https://github.com/scottwinkler/terraform-minecraft-plugin).

## NOTE

The Minecraft API endpoints are in beta and are subject to change!
So that means this API client is also in beta and is also subject to change.

## Installation

Installation can be done with a normal `go get`:

```
go get -u github.com/swinkler/go-minecraft
```
